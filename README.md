# What is this Repository?
This repo is to document my attempts and solutuions for each day of the 2024 Advent of code challenge as a beginner programmer (1.5 years with python) who is taking on Advent of Code for the first time.



# Structure of the Repository
- The Language I am using for this challenge is Python
- Each day will be given its own folder
- Most days will be split into parts p1 and p2, but not always
- I will *try* to include comments in all my solutions for improved readability
