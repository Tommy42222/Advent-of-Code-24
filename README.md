# What is this Repository?
This repo is to document my attempts and solutuions for each day of the 2024 Advent of code challenge as a beginner programmer (1.5 years with python).



# Structure of the Repository
- The main Language I am using for this is Python
- Each days challenge is given its own folder
- dataX.txt is the input data for that day
- Some days may be split into parts p1 and p2
- I will *try* to include comments in all my solutions for improved readability
